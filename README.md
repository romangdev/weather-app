# weather-app

A straightforward temperature app that returns the temperature of any city the user enters.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Fetch API, Async principles

# Optimizations
The main thing I'd do if I spent more time working on this project would be to improve the design. Its main focus was on learning about async Javascript and how to interact with APIs, which I feel like I've accomplished. But it can definitely use some extra design love and care. Additionally, it'd be fun to return far more weather data from each city, rather than just temperature, and cleanly display them to users as well.

# Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about async Javascript and handling APIs with this project. There were a few syntactical roadblocks that I eventually learned some new tricks for, such as encapsulating functions anywhere in async to utilze async methods in places where I wanted to, but initially couldn't figure out how to do so.
